<tr>
<th><b>Manufacturing Process:</b></th>
<td>Urea is made when carbon dioxide is reacted with anhydrous ammonia. 
This process happens under intense pressure, at 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
 Urea is processed to take the form of granules or solid globules known as prills.
 Dry urea is very soluble and must be kept away from moisture until its use.</td>

<th><b>Advantages of Urea:</b></th>
<td><ul>
<li>In general, urea will provide the most nitrogen at the lowest cost.</li>
<li>It is easy to store and does not pose as a fire risk for long-term storage.</li>
<li> Urea may be mixed with other fertilizers or may be applied on its own.</li>
<li>For plants that love acidic soils, urea is one of the top fertilizers for acidifying soils.</li>
</ul>

<th><font size="5"><b>Disadvantages of Urea:</b></font></th>
<td><ul>
<li><font size="5"><pre>As a result of the chemical reaction that takes place when urea is applied to the soil, special care must be taken to ensure that the nitrogen is not lost when the ammonium evaporates.</pre></font> </li>
<li><font size="5"><pre>This can make urea impractical for gardeners dealing with large plots of land.</pre></font> </li>
<li><font size="5"><pre>The high solubility of urea also makes dry storage conditions imperative.</pre></font></li>
